# Unity Basic Class

## Project Description

**Unity Basic Class** is an educational Unity project designed to demonstrate fundamental Unity classes and concepts. The project includes three distinct tasks, each focusing on essential Unity components such as `Transform`, `Time`, `Random`, and `Mathf`. It serves as a practical resource for learning how these classes are used to control object movement, timing, randomness, and mathematical operations in Unity.

## Features

- **Task 1: Random Target Movement**
  - Uses `Transform` and `Random` to move an object to a random position within specified bounds.
  - Object rotates to face the direction of movement using `Mathf`.

- **Task 2: Path-Based Movement**
  - Demonstrates moving an object along a series of waypoints.
  - Utilizes `Transform`, `Time`, and interpolation methods (`Lerp`, `Slerp`) for smooth transitions.

- **Task 3: Parameterized Movement**
  - Shows movement between two endpoints with visualized markers.
  - Employs `Transform`, `Time`, and mathematical calculations for controlled movement.

## How to Play / Controls

- **Move Object:**  
  - Press <kbd>Space</kbd> to send the object to a new random position (Task 1).
  - For path and parameterized movement (Tasks 2 & 3), objects move automatically along defined or random paths.
